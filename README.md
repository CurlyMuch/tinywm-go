# TinyWM Go

This is a port of [tinywm-xcb.c by penk](https://gist.github.com/penk/470486),
which is a port of [tinywm by mackstann](https://github.com/mackstann/tinywm). I
have added support for menu windows as read from [dewm by
driusan](https://github.com/driusan/dewm). This serves as a good starting point
for someone looking to create a window manager in Go with
[xgb](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xgb) and peek into the basics.
